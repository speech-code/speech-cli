## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Setup

Install the CLI tool directly using uv:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/speech-code/speech-cli
```

Once installed, you can run the tool from anywhere:

```bash
speech
```

#### Installing uv (if not already installed)

```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or with pip
pip install uv
```

#### For Windows Users

For the best experience, use Windows Terminal instead of the legacy Command Prompt. You can install it via:

```bash
winget install --id Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e
```

Or download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701).
